Spring WS Grails Plugin
-----------------------

This is an update to the older version of the [springws](http://grails.org/plugin/springws) plugin (v 0.5.0) with the below basic feature updates:

 - Removed dependencies from `lib` directory to avoid clash with project dependencies.
 - Updated `spring-ws-core` to version `2.1.2` from `1.5.8`.
 - Added bean property `inline` to wsdl config in order to add imported schemas inline in the `wsdl`.
 - Added a separate [sample app](https://github.com/dmahapatro/grails-springws-sample) showing the full use of latest version of `springws` plugin.
